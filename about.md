AMS Hackers is a group of people in Amsterdam who gather together to
appease our curiosity, learn and have fun by engaging in challenging
and interesting projects.

## Our philosophy

We value deep knowledge and believe that both the learning and joy you
get from a project get better as it progresses and you find your own
unique set of problems.

A lot of people underestimate their abilities. The best way to learn
is not to be afraid to try to solve problems you do not know how to
solve yet.
