AMS Hackers is a group of people in Amsterdam who gather together to
appease our curiosity, learn and have fun by engaging in challenging
and interesting projects.

The best way to characterize ams-hackers is probably to talk about the
projects we work on. We usually work together in projects for a
duration of a few months. The development sometimes continues but
outside of the ams-hacker discussions.

So, what are the kind of projects we have done so far?  We have two
successful projects.

- [**gbforth**](https://github.com/ams-hackers/gbforth). The first
  project, the one that gave birth to *ams-hackers*. It is a Game Boy
  development kit in
  [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)).


- [**delisp**](https://github.com/ams-hackers/delisp). A
  strongly-typed Lisp compiling to Javascript.


We will write soon about those projects in detail!

But this blog is about the future. We have a growing backlog of great
ideas, and we would love to tell you the story about how these
projects are built, week by week, after each session.

That is what this blog will be about!
